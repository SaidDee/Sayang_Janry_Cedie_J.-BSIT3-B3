            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>The Puerto Princesa Film Production App Tracking System is an all-in-one filmmaking platform that replaces separate tools like
                Messenger, Word, and Excel. Communication, scripting, budgeting, and file management all happen inside the system, giving film teams a single, organized hub from pre-production to post-production.
                Directors, producers, and crew can chat, call, write scripts, upload footage, and track budgets without switching apps making collaboration simpler, faster, and more convenient.</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>EcoConnect is a conceptual platform (mobile app and/or website) designed to encourage Puerto Princesa residents to actively participate in community clean-up activities.
                The platform helps users track participation, earn rewards, and connect with fellow volunteers. Designed for use by the city government or environmental NGOs, EcoConnect features activity logging,
                event announcements, leaderboards, educational materials, and reward systems to promote sustainability.
                The vision is to build a cleaner city, foster stronger community involvement, and increase environmental awareness.</p>
